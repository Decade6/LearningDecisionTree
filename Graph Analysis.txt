Training Set Size:

As the size of the training set increases, the accuracy generally increases as well.
However, accuracy drops after each incrementation of the training set size. Upon reaching 0.5, accuracy increases significantly.

Accuracy Based Upon Depth:

Accuracy starts fairly low while at a depth of one. At depths 2 and 3, accuracy increases significantly.
However, after this point accuracy continuously decreases until hitting a depth of 9.
